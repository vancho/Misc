### Project: Supermarket Sales Analysis Visualization

**Description:**
This project centered around the creation of an intricate Power BI dashboard to visualize and analyze sales data from a supermarkets network. The overarching aim was to harness the raw sales data to derive actionable insights, facilitating informed decision-making processes.

**Key tasks:**

**Data cleaning and preprocessing:**
Imported the supermarket sales dataset into Power BI and performed an initial assessment to understand the data structure and quality.
Addressed missing values, any inconsistencies within the data, ensuring a clean and reliable dataset for analysis.
Applied various transformations and reshaped the dataset to make it more suitable for visualization and analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Conducted an in-depth exploration of the sales data, uncovering trends, patterns, and key metrics.
Identified crucial KPIs, such as average price by product line, sales quantities, etc.
Created calculated fields to enhance the dataset with additional metrics and information vital for the visualization process.

**Data visualization using Power BI:**
Designed a series of interactive visualizations, including bar charts to represent sales figures, line graphs to track sales over time, and pie charts to depict payment type breakdown.
Incorporated slicers and filters, enabling users to interact with the dashboard, drill down into specific data segments, and view data from various angles.
Organized the dashboard layout to ensure a user-friendly experience, with clear visual hierarchies and easy navigation.

**Integration with External API:**
Integrated Power BI with an external API to fetch currency conversion rates, ensuring that the dashboard reflects the most recent and accurate total sales figures in the chosen currency.
