### Project: Electric cars of State Washington Analysis and Visualization (Python, Power Bi, Tableau)

**Description:**


This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data pertaining to electric cars. The dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). The primary objective is to gain insights into the electric car market trends within the region, utilizing a comprehensive dataset that includes various attributes of electric vehicles.

**Key Tasks:**

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing in Python Pandas:**
The raw data is transformed into a structured and analysis-ready format. This process includes handling missing values, normalizing data, filtering out irrelevant information, and ensuring data integrity for accurate analysis.

**Data Visualization Using Power BI and Tableau:**
The cleaned and preprocessed data is then visualized using Power BI and Tableau, two of the most advanced data visualization tools. The visualization includes creating:

Bar Charts: To represent data in a comparative manner, showcasing trends and distributions across various categories.
Area Charts: For illustrating quantitative data over time, highlighting the growth or decline in electric car model years and types.
Filters and Slicers: Implemented to allow users to interact with the data, enabling them to drill down into specific aspects like model types, registration years and vehicle types.
The combination of these tools and methods provides a comprehensive and interactive way to analyze and understand the electric car landscape in Washington State.
