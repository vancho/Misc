### Project: Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey

**Description:**
This project revolves around analyzing a dataset of survey responses from individuals in the tech industry. The primary objective is to understand their professional backgrounds, coding experience, learning preferences, and compensation trends. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of different facets of the respondents' tech journey, such as their educational background, programming languages they use, their experience in the field, and more.

**Key tasks:**

**Data cleaning and preprocessing:** This step ensures that the dataset is free from duplicates, missing values are appropriately handled, and the data is in a suitable format for analysis. Special attention is given to columns that require transformation or binning, such as experience years.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In this phase, the data is deeply analyzed to answer specific questions. These questions range from basic counts, like the number of survey respondents, to more intricate analysis, like the average and median compensation for Python developers in each country. Through EDA, insights about remote work, programming preferences, and the impact of education on compensation are derived.

**Data visualization:** Visual representations of the data are created to better understand the distribution and trends. Various charts are constructed to depict the educational levels of respondents, the ways they learn to code, the online resources they prefer for learning, and their coding experience distribution, etc.
